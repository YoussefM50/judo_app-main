   "screen1dialog1": "Ancient history records for us the first start of this type of fight, which is the famous battle that took place between (Nomino Sokuna) and the warrior (Taima Nokohama) in Japan during the days of Emperor (Sunin) in 23 BC.",
   "screen1dialog2": "The two men met and fought each other, and each had their own style of fighting, consisting of wrestling skills in their primitive form, and the arts of striking with hand and foot. The battle ended with the killing of the warrior (Taima Nokohama) as a result of a strong blow to the foot and breaking his ribs, and that was the fight in Japan.",
   "screen1dialog3": "After that, the ruling Japanese Empire took care of this fight. In the year 1375 AD, the Japanese Emperor (Shomo) devised a day for the celebration of the warrior knights, and it is known as (Sandotsu Day), and this celebration included (shooting arrows - archery from horses - Japanese wrestling).",
   "screen1dialog4": "After 300 years of stopping that day, this celebration was resumed again in the same style, with the aim of showing the royal families the ingenuity of their knights.",
   "screen1dialog5": "In that period, one of the samurai knights laid the first stone in the sport of judo, which is the method of (Kumi Uchi), which is the method of fighting hand to hand, and this method was known after that as (Jujitsu).",
   "screen1dialog6": "And researchers in Japanese history said that it is possible that the first school arose on the method of (Kumi Uchi) in fighting was in the late sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth century, and that the origin of this art was vague, but the official history of Japan, which was written by the emperor in the year 720 AD, referred to a cycle ( Lekar-Korea-Struggle of Power) in which I practiced this sport.",
   "screen1subtitle1": "jujitsu",
   "screen1dialog7": "Jujitsu is the art of combat during war, and it was without rules. Its goal was to preserve life by killing the opponent, as defeat meant death and victory meant life. It was used by ancient Japanese warriors (samurai), the nobility, and rulers. It originated from Tibet, then spread to China and from there to Japan. The credit for bringing it to Japan goes to a student named Akamatsu Oshito from Nishijin, Nagasaki, who was studying in China. He noticed that when a strong wind blew on a large willow tree, it would break under the force of the wind, while the branches of the soft and slender cherry tree would bend and then return to their original position after the wind subsided. From here, the spiritual philosophy of this art was built, based on the saying, (Do not be rigid,) meaning that having fixed muscular strength would lead to breaking, as there is always someone stronger when compared. (Do not be weak) meaning that having a weak body without physical fitness would create difficulties. Instead, be strong by acquiring elements of flexibility, strength, speed, endurance, and agility, combined with fundamental skills to give you high mobility. Jujitsu has risks and moves that can lead to death in some cases.",
   "screen1dialog8": "The art of jujitsu has different schools, among the oldest and most famous",
   "screen1dialog9": "_ School (Takno Uchi) and its founder (Takno Uchi Hisa Mori) in 1532 A.D. He taught his students the art of (Kogyosoku), which is the art of control and reservation. \n_ School (Kito) and its founder is (Tirada Kan Amun). \n_ The school (Ki Oshin) and its founder (Anyo Gami Naga Katsu). \n_ The school (Yushin and Miura) as two schools with a very great reputation in Japan, and two of its teachers won a very great reputation, and they are (Toshuka) and (Asumata Yushin).",
   "screen1dialog10": "It is a combat sport that combines physical fitness, discipline and sound thinking, and it is a traditional Japanese sport. \n\nIt differs greatly from its counterparts in other combat sports, as it does not depend on kicking, pushing, striking with hands, or any other fighting techniques, as well as it is devoid of weapons and tools that are used in other combat sports. \n\nThe literary translation of the word Judo in English is high art, but this translation is misleading because it appeals to the comic image of the sport. \n\nDes Marwood indicated that Judo is a word consisting of two syllables: \n_ Ju, which means fine or gentle, and is in English “gentle.”\n_ Du (D0) means art, and it is in English (art). )\n\n But in fact, the art is an analysis of skills through the opponent's defense in a closed space, and the word Ju symbolizes the principle of not responding violently to violence, and the criticism of the word Ju is derived from Kendo and symbolizes force against force. \n\n It is said that the sport of judo is not Japanese, but it has its ancient historical roots. There was a man named (Akiyama Oshito) from Nagasaki Province in Japan studying in China, and there he was impressed by the wrestling of the people of China, and that was in the seventh century BC, then he transferred it to his home, but China transferred it from ancient Egypt, where the ancient pharaohs practiced this type of wrestling since three thousand years BC, and then it was transferred by the Hyksos to Southeast Asia after the end of their raids and defeat by the ancient pharaohs in Egypt, where there are many drawings that resemble a lot of Judo movements now and also tying the belt on the abdomen, on the walls of Bani Hassan temples, and many ancient Pharaonic tombs.\n\n Judo is one of the typical Japanese sports with an international character or characteristic, and it contributes, being a problem of culture in itself, to bringing about friendship and peace between countries and peoples of the world in a tremendous way these days, by providing people with an area in which they can achieve fruitful exchange among themselves, and then we find that the game Judo provides help and aid to promote happiness, prosperity and well-being for all human beings, and that is the message of judo, and there is no higher goal than this goal.\n\n Many decades ago, the sport of judo was considered a sport in which only the Japanese were distinguished, but with the achievement of the international character of this sport, the performance of judo players from all over the world has clearly improved, and they have shown skill and strength when compared with non-Japanese players to outperform the Japanese judo players until They became Olympic or world champions, and their achievements show very clearly that the sport of judo is no longer a monopoly on Japan, but has become the property of the whole world, and this helps in sparking further spread and development of judo. \n\n The emergence of the sport of judo in its current form is due to Jigor Kano, who was born in 1860 AD, and learned literature and philosophy at the University of Tokyo in 1881 AD, and is considered one of the founding members of the Olympic Games in 1896 AD, and Kano took over the Ministry of Education in his country, making judo among the subjects education in schools at that time, then he died in 1938 AD - during his return trip at sea due to a sudden illness, after a meeting of the International Olympic Federation in Cairo, and Kano before his death had made great efforts in all parts of the world in order to spread the sport of judo and increase practitioners at different levels. \n\n In 1882, Jigor Kano established an international academy for teaching various judo arts in Tokyo.\n\n And Tony, Geoffrey points out that in ancient times in Japan and several centuries ago, power and strength were concentrated in the hands of the strong feudal government at the expense of the weak central government, so each ruler of a region at that time had a group of warriors and samurai fighters, who relied on them to protect the region from attacks. And external problems, so this class of people was training hard and diligently to fight by using hands, and also by using weapons. \n\n And there were specialized schools to teach these different martial arts and movements to the samurai class so that there would be those who could deter the people during the outbreak of popular revolutions and riots.\n\n Until the mid-19th century, no ordinary person could train in those martial arts; they were exclusively reserved for samurai warriors. However, a new government came into power in 1873, ending this system and relieving the samurai class of their duties, sending them into retirement. This was the main reason for the division of the people into two groups during the disturbances and revolutions. One group suppressed the riots and represented the police while the other group tried to regain their former position in the samurai class and represented the police group. When Jigoro Kano was eighteen years old in 1878, he gathered all the movements that the samurai class used to train in, which were called Jujutsu. He did this in the town of Shinorio under the supervision of two men named Fukuda and Iso, who held high positions in the Military Academy, which was completed in 1895 in Kyoto, Japan. Kano arranged and eliminated the dangerous and deadly movements, analyzed them, and identified the main points of how to teach these movements to the general public in a special school. That school was the Kodokan, which we mentioned earlier was established in 1882 in Tokyo, Japan. \n\n The Kodokan is the place where people come from all over the world for education and training, and to know everything new about the sport of Judo, because of the presence of high-level experiences from teachers and trainers who can consolidate and refine these experiences among the arrivals to the Kodokan.\n\n The sport of judo had entered Egypt for the first time in 1934 through Japanese experts to train the army and police forces at that time on the combat skills found in this sport in this sport, and in 1952 AD the International Judo Federation (I J F) was formed, in which so far more From a hundred countries, judo was accepted as an Olympic sport in 1964 at the Tokyo Olympic Games.",

   "scree5paragraph1": "The great effort placed on the player's muscles when executing physical effort requires the use of an additional amount of oxygen, and this comes with regulating the breathing process and increasing its speed, as well as the speed of blood circulation. Increasing physical effort and body movements go hand in hand with increasing the metabolic process.' Nutrition for the body, and the body’s systems adapt themselves depending on the external conditions related to the player’s movements and efforts.",
   "scree5paragraph2": "Therefore, it was necessary for the athlete to gradually decline in effort and movement so that the body's internal systems, in turn, could gradually perform their functions to keep pace with the athlete's effort and movement, since the energy of the body's systems to perform their functions is limited.",
   "scree5paragraph3": "The movements and efforts must not exceed the rate of this energy so as not to cause adverse results and health and physical damage. These devices must be adequately prepared to suit the physical effort expected to be performed. This is done by doing some physical exercises and running exercises of gradual strength before starting In matches, we reach an increase in breathing speed and thus we find a large amount of oxygen in the player’s body, to help the muscles and body systems perform their function, and this prevents common sports injuries.",
   "scree5paragraph4": "But if the body's systems are no longer adequately prepared to accept the maximum effort expected to be performed, then sports injuries can occur, or the first appearance of fatigue, which is called (psychosis). This phenomenon can continue with the player, so he is unable to perform his duty on the field.' Until the internal systems are organized and prepared to accept the effort required to be performed, then the player becomes ready to carry out his duties, that is, after he obtains his second breath.",
